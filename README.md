# **_DEVELOPMENT CURRICULUM_**

These are the essential skills that every prospective software developer in 2020 must be familiar with. I have built up this resource library by by curating our favorite blog posts, documentation sites and courses from around the web.

Here, you have access to some of my best curated resources which will help you understand the specifics of the various technologies in depth.

# **Setting up the development environment**

## 0. Operating System (For Windows Users only)

_You might want to shift to Linux or MacOS before you start the actual development._

> Unix by design was built for programming and development across the CS domains.
> It is the simplicity and straightforward ways in which you can find every programming environment available on a UNIX based/like OS that makes it better as a “programmer’s OS”.
> This is the reason why top developers and scientists use Linux or MacOS. They share the same terminal.

- ### Choose a Linux Distribution

  - **_Research thoroughly_** before choosing a Linux distribution.
    _My recommendations are :_ - Manjaro - MX Linux - Linux Mint - Ubuntu - For advanced Linux users : Arch Linux. _(my personal favourite and daily driver!)_

    - ***Factors to consider*** before installing a Linux distro:-
        		- Stable vs Rolling release
        		- Availability of applications
        		- Development friendly
        		- Security
        		- Package Manager and its download speeds
        		- Desktop Environment  *(personal favourite: XFCE)*

> NOTE : There is no best Linux distribution. It depends on one's personal preferences.

## **1. Terminal**

It is strongly recommended that Windows users switch to a dual boot Linux configuration.
You might want to get that ugly terminal pumped up before starting development.
- ### **Install terminator**

- ### **Install zsh**
  The commands are 99% same. Zsh is the superior alternative of bash shell.
- ### **Switch to zsh as your default shell**
- ### **Install "Oh My Zsh"**
  It is a **zsh framework** which comes bundled with tons of plugins, helpers, themes, etc.
- ### **Install OhMyZsh extensions, themes, plugins etc.**
  You will need to ***configure .zshrc***
  - zsh-autocomplete
  - git 
  - jump
- ### **Customize the terminal to your liking.**
    #### Some recommendations :
    - Change the colour schemes and the **theme**
    - Try out Powerlevel9k
    - Apply a Powerline Nerd Font to your terminal. Eg : Hack Mono
- ### **Learn all the basic commands**
        - cd
    	- curl
    	- wget
        - ls / ll
        - rm , mkdir
        - pd
  
- ### **Basic Git commands**
  > These are of utmost importantance especially during version control - when working in a team.

  Here is a list of commands, not in a particular order: 
  - clone
  - push
  - pull
  - rebase
  - merge
  - fork
  - revert
  - reset
  - branch
  - checkout
  - remote
  - add
  - status
  - log
  - commit
  - init

      -  Command Mode and Insert Mode
      -  !
      -  wq
      -  dd
      -  dw
      -  %s

- ### **Package managers**
    - Install nodejs and npm
    - yarn
    - homebrew (macOS)
    - Node version manager - nvm
    - ### For Linux users 
       - snap
  
  
## **2. Coding environment**
*A coding environment should be properly configured in order to increase your overall productivity during work.*


My general recommendations are as follows :- 
- ### **Terminal Editors**
   - vim
   - nano
  
- ### **Text Editors** 
  - VSCode *(personal favourite)*
  - Sublime Text 3
  - Atom
  - Brackets
  
  > **Currently VSCode is hands down the best editor cum IDE till date.**

- ### **Integrated Development Environments**
  - Jetbrains : Webstorm / Pycharm / Intellij Idea

>A software engineer's text editor of choice is somewhat just a personal preference. There isn't necessarily one right answer. 

>Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is my current text editor of choice. It is lightweight and easily extendable. It is built and maintained by Microsoft so it has really good native TypeScript support and is updated every month.

- ### **If youre using VSCode, do install tons of extentions and themes!**
    - git lens
    - code runner
    - live server
    - prettier
    - intellisense for all languages
    - intellicode
    - bracket pair colourizer 2
    - css peek
    - auto import
    - emmet
    - themes, icons based on personal preference.
